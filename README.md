# Email-Spam-Filtering
In this project I am developing a email spam filter using some machine learning classification algorithms. This project will help any user in classifying the spam or legitimate(not spam) mails in two different classes. 
We are using two different machine learning algorithms for developing our classification model which are:
- Naive Bayes Algorithm
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) Algorithm
